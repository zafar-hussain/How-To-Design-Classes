 * . . . Develop a program that computes the cost of selling bulk
 * coffee at a specialty coffee seller from a receipt that includes
 * the kind of coffee, the unit price, and the total amount (weight)
 * sold. If the sale is for less than 5,000 pounds, there is no discount. For sales of 5,000 pounds to 20,000 pounds, the seller
 * grants a discount of 10%. For sales of 20,000 pounds or more,
 * the discount is 25%. . . .
 * Donâ€™t forget to adapt the examples, too.
